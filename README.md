## Background

You play as a burned secret agent who was stranded at the top of a mountain ridge. You must fight your way through the peaks and ice caverns to reach safety. Use a variety of stealth and brute force tactics to make it back alive.

## Maps and levels

### Maps

Maps introduce different monsters and environmental hazards

###

Each map has a set of levels. Levels increase in difficulty as a map progresses. Levels have a series of checkpoints that can be reached. If you die in a level you will be resurrected at the nearest checkpoint. Dying will deduct a life. Levels can have secret stashes that you must break into. Levels can have ambient items which can be broken with attacks, but don't prevent movement. Ambient items may contain bombs that will explode after breaking them open.
